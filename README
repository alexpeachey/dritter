== Dritter

Dritter is a simplified Twitter app put together to show off how the Draper gem can be used to simplify views and keep logic where it belongs: in the code.

The idea is to better separate your concerns and keep your views light and as "dumb" as possible. Using Draper or any Presenter-type pattern also lets you slim your models as it takes methods used only for display purposes and moves them out of the models and closer to the front end.

Draper can be found on github: https://github.com/jcasimir/draper
